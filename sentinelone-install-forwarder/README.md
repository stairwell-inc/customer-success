# Inception Forwarder Installer - SentinelOne Remote Script Orchestration

*This requires you have access to the Remote Script Orchestration (RSO) capability in SentinelOne.*

The Stairwell Inception Forwarder enables automatic and continuous artifact collection, including existing at-rest artifacts. This script enables organizations leveraging SentinelOne to install this forwarder using the existing EDR agent. Once installed, the Forwarder will be managed via the Inception web interface.

See the Knowledge Base in the Inception interface for more details on usage.
